SlickCMS Classic ASP
====================

A Blog/CMS inspired by WordPress, built using VBScript in Classic ASP and SQL Server.

It has served me well, as the platform for my own website http://slickhouse.com and also as a base for some client projects. However, I've retired it whilst I work on a new (ha!) MVC .NET version. There's also a Web Forms .NET version of SlickCMS that I may release in the future too.

Feel free to look around at the awesome that is/was VBScript!
